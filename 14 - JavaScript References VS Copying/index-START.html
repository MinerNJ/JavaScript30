    // start with strings, numbers and booleans
    let age = 100;
    let age2 = age;

    let name = 'Nick'
    let name2 = name;

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players;

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    team[3] = 'Nick';

    // however what happens when we update that array?
    // now here is the problem!
    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!
    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!
    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    const team2 = players.slice();
    team2[4] = 'Kirby';
    console.log(team2);
    console.log(players);

    // one way
    // or create a new array and concat the old one in

    const team3 = [].concat(players);
    console.log(team3);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players];
    console.log(team4);

    const team5 = Array.from(players);

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    // const captain = person;
    // captain.age = 99;
    // console.log(captain);
    // console.log(person);
    //Changing something this way changes the original object

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const captain2 = Object.assign({}, person, {number: 99, age: 28});
    console.log(captain2);
    console.log(person);

    // Similar to React:
    const captain3 = {...person};
    console.log(captain3);

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. 
    //lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.

    const nick = {
      name: 'Nick',
      age: 28,
      social: {
        website: 'MinerNJ@github.io',
        LinkedIn: 'Nicholas J. Miner'
      }
    };

    console.log(nick);

    // const dev = Object.assign({}, nick);
    // dev.social.LinkedIn = 'coolguy';
    // console.log(nick);
    // console.log(dev);

    //changes the original object. Assign only works one level deep, as mentioned above.

    const dev2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(nick))
      dev2.social.LinkedIn = 'coolguy';
      console.log(nick);
      console.log(dev2);

    //poor man's data clone. Take the JSON representing the object, parse all its contents
    //to strings, then create a new JSON object from the parsed String data.
